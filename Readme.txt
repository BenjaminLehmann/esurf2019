Dears users,

Here the sequence to use these codes.
This series of calculation should be used following the alphabetic order from A to C:

code : "A_Mask_cosmo_MBTP1"
--> Calculates the exposure age for 10Be concentration for each erosion histories

code : "B_Inversion_Erosion_ts_MBTP1"
--> Inverts the possible erosion histories from OSL surface exposure profile, using the Mask calculate using code "A_..." 

code "C_Plot_Inversion_MBTP1"
--> Plots the results

All details of inputs, outputs data, units ... are in the heading of each codes.
Template data set are in "TCN_OSL_data_base".

Please contact me for any informations: lehmann.benj@gmail.com

Cheers,

Benjamin Lehmann
